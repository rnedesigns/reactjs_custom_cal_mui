# reactjs_custom_cal_mui
### ReactJS Custom Calendar with Material UI:

* React JS
* Material UI
* Bulma

Note: The codebase is generated with *create-react-app* CLI tool by running ```npx create-react-app reactjs_custom_cal_mui```

### Setting Up:
* 1. Install the required packages and dependencies using the command: ```npm i``` and hit enter in the CMD or Terminal
* 2. Run ```npm start```
* 3. The application will start running on your default browser on *http://localhost:3000/*
* 4. Here I have installed required packages: material-ui, bulma and react hook module

Note: the specific version of react hook is compatible with the react version in the package.json i.e., 16.8.0 and it is work-in-progress
